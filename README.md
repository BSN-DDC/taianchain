Taian Chain is developed based on FISCO BCOS framework. FISCO BCOS is an enterprise-level financial consortium blockchain underlying platform built by the Golden Chain Alliance Open Source Working Group, which was open sourced in 2017. It has the advantages of strong performance (single-chain over 20,000 TPS, new scalable RPBFT consensus algorithm), controlled security (support for group ring signature and homomorphic encryption, regulatory friendly), and ease of use.
